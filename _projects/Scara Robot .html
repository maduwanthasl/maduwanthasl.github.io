title: "SCARA Robot (PRRR Configuration)"
date: 2024-12-16
excerpt: "This project focuses on building and analyzing a SCARA (PRRR) robot arm with 4 Degrees of Freedom (DoF). It combines both kinematic analysis and practical implementation, including calculations for forward kinematics, inverse kinematics, and Jacobian analysis. The project culminates in a demonstration where the robot performs precise pick-and-place tasks and can hold objects weighing up to 0.8 kg.<br/>
