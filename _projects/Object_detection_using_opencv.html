title: "Object detection using OpenCV"
date: 2024-06-25
excerpt: "This project demonstrates object detection and tracking using OpenCV. The implementation includes both single object tracking and multiple object tracking from a given video. Additionally, the project supports real-time tracking using a webcam.By leveraging OpenCV's robust computer vision algorithms, this project can detect and track objects, visualizing their movement across frames. This can be useful for a variety of applications, including surveillance, activity recognition, and more. <br/>
