title: "Analogue High Frequency Amplifier V1"
date: 2024-07-10
excerpt: "An amplifier is an electronic device that can increase the power of a signal (a time-varying voltage or current). Depending on its frequency of operation, we have several types of amplifiers. As the name suggests, high-frequency amplifiers are designed to operate at high frequencies. These have a vast variety of applications like telecommunication, high-speed electronic measurements, laser research, and photonic research. When designing a high-frequency amplifier, factors like bandwidth, low noise, high gain, and noise immunity are extremely important. This project aims to build a high-frequency amplifier using transistors which can drive a headphone. <br/>
