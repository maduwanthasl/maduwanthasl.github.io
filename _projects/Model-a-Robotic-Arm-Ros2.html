title: "Model a Robotic Arm in ROS2"
date: 2024-07-22
excerpt: "In this project, I modeled the MyCobot 280 robotic arm within a ROS2 workspace. The MyCobot 280 is a lightweight, collaborative robotic arm designed for various applications in research and education. In the github repo you'll find images of the robotic arm, both in its real-world setup and as modeled in simulation. <br/>
