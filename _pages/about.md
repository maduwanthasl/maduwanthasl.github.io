![Cartoon Inforgrapics of Combining Additive manufacturing, Robotics and AI](/images/Header_image.jpg){: algin-right width="300px"}👋🏼 Hello there, I’m Hirusha Madhuwantha!

## 🤖 Robotics, AI & Additive Manufacturing Enthusiast

I am deeply passionate about the transformative power of **geometry processing** in **AI, robotics, additive manufacturing, and 4D printing**. As a **Research Intern at the Singapore University of Technology and Design’s Digital Manufacturing and Design Centre (DManD)**, I am exploring the intersection of **4D printing, additive manufacturing, and robotics**. My work focuses on leveraging **geometric principles** to design adaptive structures and optimize fabrication processes, bridging the gap between digital design and physical realization.

With expertise in **parametric design tools like Rhino and Grasshopper**, as well as hands-on experience with **FullControl GCode and ROS2**, I aim to contribute to cutting-edge research in **geometry processing**. I am particularly excited about the potential of **4D printing and adaptive geometries** to revolutionize industries ranging from **healthcare to aerospace**.

By collaborating with leading researchers and innovators, I strive to deepen my understanding and drive groundbreaking advancements in the field. For me, **geometry is more than a mathematical discipline**—it is a **universal language** that connects ideas across domains, enabling us to design, optimize, and create in ways that were once unimaginable.
