# 👋🏼 Hello there, I’m Hirusha Madhuwantha!
I’m passionate about how geometry processing can transform AI, robotics, additive manufacturing, and 4D printing. As a Research Intern at the **Digital Manufacturing and Design Centre (DManD) at <a href='https://www.sutd.edu.sg/' target='_blank'>Singapore University of Technology and Design</a>**, I’m working at the intersection of **4D printing, machine learning, additive manufacturing and robotics**, exploring how geometric principles can help design adaptive structures and improve fabrication processes.

I have experience with parametric design tools like Rhino and Grasshopper, as well as FullControl GCode and ROS2, which I use to develop smarter, more efficient designs. I’m especially excited about how 4D printing and adaptive geometries can push the boundaries of industries like healthcare and aerospace.

By collaborating with leading researchers and innovators, I strive to deepen my understanding and drive groundbreaking advancements in the field. For me, **geometry is more than a mathematical discipline**—it is a **universal language** that connects ideas across domains, enabling us to design, optimize, and create in ways that were once unimaginable.
