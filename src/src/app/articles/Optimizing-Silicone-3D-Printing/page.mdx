## Exploring the Impact of Printing Conditions on Silicone Cube Quality Using SLO-JO and Thivex Additives

## Introduction
Silicone 3D printing is gaining traction for its versatility in producing soft robotic components. However, achieving high-quality prints requires a precise balance of materials, additives, and printing parameters. In this experiment, I tested different combinations of silicone mixtures, speeds, and pressures to determine their impact on print quality.

## Materials Used
- **Silicone Type A and B** – base materials mixed in equal ratios  
- **SLO-JO Additive** – extends cure time for more workable printing  
- **Thivex (2%)** – increases viscosity for better layer adhesion  
- **Silicon Type** – *Ecoflex 00-30* (platinum-cure silicone rubber compound)

## Experimental Setup
The study involved printing **six silicone cubes** under varying conditions:

- **Cubes 1, 2, 3:**  
  Silicone Type B + 4% SLO-JO + Type A

- **Cubes 4, 5, 6:**  
  Silicone Type B + 4% SLO-JO + Type A + 2% Thivex

**Observation:**  
Prints 1–3 used low-viscosity silicone, resulting in scattered and uneven layers.  
Prints 4–6 used Thivex for higher viscosity, showing better layer consistency and shape retention.

## Parameters Tested

| Cube Number | Speed (F) | Pressure (kPa) | Notes |
|-------------|-----------|----------------|-------|
| **1** | F2400 | 70 kPa | Standard mix |
| **2** | F2400 | 90 kPa | Higher pressure → denser extrusion |
| **3** | F2400 | 90 kPa | Printed 40 min after mixing |
| **4** | F2400 | 90 kPa | Added 2% Thivex → higher viscosity |
| **5** | F1800 | 100 kPa | Slower speed, higher pressure |
| **6** | F900 | 70 kPa | Slowest speed, low pressure |

## Observations and Results

### **Prints 1–3 (Low Viscosity — SLO-JO Only)**
These prints showed scattered flow due to low viscosity:

- **Print 1:**  
  70 kPa → lower flow, slightly controlled but still scattered

- **Print 2:**  
  90 kPa → more scattering, higher flow increased layer height

- **Print 3:**  
  Printed 40 minutes after mixing → partial curing caused excessive spreading and major scattering

---

### **Prints 4–6 (High Viscosity — SLO-JO + Thivex)**
Adding Thivex increased viscosity and improved print structure.

#### **Print 4**
- 90 kPa + Thivex → controlled flow, minimal scattering  
- Slight surface pattern indicates possible Z-calibration issue

#### **Print 5**
- 100 kPa + Thivex → reduced surface pattern seen in Print 4  
- Bed height slightly increased halfway → improved consistency  
- Lower speed (F1800) helped maintain flow stability

#### **Print 6**
- 70 kPa + F900 → cleaner results after nozzle/bed tuning  
- Initial layers showed uneven distribution due to flow mismatch  
- Very low speed → shallow layer height and small gaps

## Conclusion

### **Key Takeaways**
- **Higher Pressure → Stronger Flow**  
  Increasing pressure improves extrusion control and consistency, especially with thicker silicone mixes.

- **Lower Flow Rate → Lower Speed Needed**  
  When pressure is low, reducing print speed prevents scattering and ensures better layer formation.

- **Z-Height Calibration is Critical**  
  Incorrect Z-gap causes uneven layers, patterns, or weak adhesion.  
  Precise Z-calibration becomes even more important when switching between low- and high-viscosity materials.
